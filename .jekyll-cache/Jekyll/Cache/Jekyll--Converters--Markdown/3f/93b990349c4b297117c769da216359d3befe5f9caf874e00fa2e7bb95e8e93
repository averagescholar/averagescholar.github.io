I"|<p>As my main research interests Computer Vision and Unsupervised Learning, understanding the background knowledge of these fields is my first learning goal.</p>

<p>For Computer Vision, the plan is to take the Udacity course, [Introduction to Computer Vision] (https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision–ud810), to have a quick grasp of the field. For references, [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications] (https://szeliski.org/Book/), and [Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference] (http://www.computervisionmodels.com/) are good textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate level. I prefer the former because it has a recent (2020) update.</p>

<p>I also need to have a fundamental background in statistics and Bayesian inference; hence, the other two books that I need to read are [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning] (http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) (PRML) and [The Elements of Statistical Learning] (https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) (ESLII). I will go for PRML first as it is directly related to my research topic.</p>

<p>Overall, there are three books that I desperately need to read and a course that I need to attend: A, B, C, D.</p>

<p>The learning plan is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the Udacity course to have a clear view of the vision field.</li>
  <li>Read PRML</li>
  <li>Read Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</li>
  <li>Read ESLII</li>
</ul>

<p>The learning process will be done in the morning every day, and the goal is to complete the vision course and PRML before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>To evaluate my understanding, I will have a post to describes what I’ve learned from each lesson (video course) and chapter (book). Sometimes there will be a little code for deepening the understanding of the subject.</p>
