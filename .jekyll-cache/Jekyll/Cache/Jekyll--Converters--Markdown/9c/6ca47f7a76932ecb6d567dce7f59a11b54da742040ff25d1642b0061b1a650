I"¥<p>As my main research interests Computer Vision and Unsupervised Learning, understanding the background knowledge of these fields is my first learning goal.</p>

<p>For Computer Vision, the plan is to take the Udacity course, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810">Introduction to Computer Vision</a>, to have a quick grasp of the field. For references, <a href="https://szeliski.org/Book/">Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</a>, and <a href="http://www.computervisionmodels.com/">Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference</a> are good textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate level. I prefer the former because it has a recent (2020) update.</p>

<p>I also need to have a fundamental background in statistics and Bayesian inference; hence, the other two books that I need to read are <a href="http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf">Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a> (PRML) and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> (ESLII). I will go for PRML first as it is directly related to my research topic.</p>

<p>The learning plan is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the Udacity course to have a clear view of the vision field.</li>
  <li>Read PRML</li>
  <li>Read Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications</li>
  <li>Read ESLII</li>
</ul>

<p>The learning process will be done in the morning every day, and the goal is to complete the vision course and PRML before the end of 2020.</p>

<p>Learning fundamental is just a part of the Ph.D. life, as the students also need to have the actual research. The field of Deep Learning has been going very fast; besides learning, the main part of my day is to read what others have been doing. I will write down my thoughts and understanding of some important works of the field.</p>
