The author of this blog has just moved from an undergraduate student to a Ph.D. position. Conventionally, for a student without a master degree, the Ph.D. program would take from 5 to 6 years to complete, as he has to attend entry-level courses to acquire a solid foundation. However, here in Australia, Ph.D. students are assumed to have already had the proper knowledge that the program only takes around 3-4 years. Hence, it is the students' responsibility to acquire the foundation knowledge to make the most out of their Ph.D. program. 

Learning something new is always one of the most challenging tasks, especially when the subject is abstract such as Mathematics. Therefore, the author decided to log his learning journey in this blog, with the hope that it could motivate himself, and someone who read this, pursue this challenging and rewarding journey.

The blog contains thoughts, explanations, and codes for fundamental books in Deep Learning (i.e., PRML, ESLII) and Computer Vision. Sometimes, there will be several articles about important works that revolutionalized deep learning fields and some other interesting papers.
