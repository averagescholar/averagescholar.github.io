As my main research interests Computer Vision and Unsupervised Learning, understanding the background knowledge of these fields is my first learning goal. 

For Computer Vision, the plan is to take the Udacity course, [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810), to have a quick grasp of the field. For references, [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://szeliski.org/Book/), and [Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference](http://www.computervisionmodels.com/) are good textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate level. I prefer the former because it has a recent (2020) update.

I also need to have a fundamental background in statistics and Bayesian inference; hence, the other two books that I need to read are [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) (PRML) and [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) (ESLII). I will go for PRML first as it is directly related to my research topic. 

The learning plan is: 
- Complete the Udacity course to have a clear view of the vision field. 
- Read PRML 
- Read Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications
- Read ESLII

The learning process will be done in the morning every day, and the goal is to complete the vision course and PRML before the end of 2020. 

Learning fundamental is just a part of the Ph.D. life, as the students also need to have the actual research. The field of Deep Learning has been going very fast; besides learning, the main part of my day is to read what others have been doing. I will write down my thoughts and understanding of some important works of the field.
