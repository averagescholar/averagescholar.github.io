&lt;p&gt;For Computer Vision, the plan is to take the Udacity course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810&quot;&gt;Introduction to Computer Vision&lt;/a&gt;, to have a quick grasp of the field. For references, &lt;a href=&quot;https://szeliski.org/Book/&quot;&gt;Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computervisionmodels.com/&quot;&gt;Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference&lt;/a&gt; are good textbooks for advanced undergraduate and graduate level. I prefer the former because it has a recent (2020) update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also need to have a fundamental background in statistics and Bayesian inference; hence, the other two books that I need to read are &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf&quot;&gt;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; (PRML) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/&quot;&gt;The Elements of Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt; (ESLII). I will go for PRML first as it is directly related to my research topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning plan is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete the Udacity course to have a clear view of the vision field.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read PRML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read ESLII&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The learning process will be done in the morning every day, and the goal is to complete the vision course and PRML before the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning fundamental is just a part of the Ph.D. life, as the students also need to have the actual research. The field of Deep Learning has been going very fast; besides learning, the main part of my day is to read what others have been doing. I will write down my thoughts and understanding of some important works of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="general" /><summary type="html">As my main research interests Computer Vision and Unsupervised Learning, understanding the background knowledge of these fields is my first learning goal.</summary></entry></feed>
